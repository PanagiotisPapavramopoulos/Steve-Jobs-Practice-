          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur
            who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple
            Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod,
            iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern
            technology. <br /><br />
            Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who
            gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping
            out of college and experi menting with different pursuits before
            co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left the company
            in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, then returned to Apple
            more than a decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a long battle
            with pancreatic cancer.
